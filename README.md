### Instructions to set up SQL database
1. Database is hosted using elephantsql.com (can also use postgres.app to locally host)
2. Can graphically view database using postico (if not working, use URL and create new database 
to check credentials)
3. Run backend and port forward to the internet (can use either ngrok or port forwarding built into
vscode)
4. Make sure the data sources instances are using the correct URL (port forwarded link)
5. Can use Postman for better interfacing with the API
